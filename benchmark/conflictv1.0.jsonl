Importantly, drop-outs from all weight loss trials are in the order of 35–50% [13,14] and the key factor in whether a participant finishes a trial is whether they like and are able to stick to the lifestyle change.

This apparent diminution in the benefits may be due in part to a decline in dietary adherence over time; additionally, heterogeneity in reporting of medication changes and adjustment for reduction of these in meta-analyses has been suggested to contribute to an underestimation of effect on glycaemic control.17 The available evidence has key limitations, including in the variation in definition of what constitutes a ‘low-carbohydrate’ diet, and there remains a lack of pragmatic trials to demonstrate the feasibility of supporting such diets in routine practice. In most trials to date, the programme has been delivered by specialist staff, offering in-depth advice and support which is unrealistic if this is to be delivered at scale.

Indeed, the Cochrane review of Brown and Goodfellow [42], comparing the transverse incision with the midline incision in the upper and lower abdominal surgery, demonstrates that the transverse and oblique incisions have a weaker impact on the pulmonary function, especially in the early post-operative days, while a reduced tendency to dehiscence and infection of the surgical wound and to the appearance of the incisional hernia is observed; furthermore, the transverse incision appears to be associated with less pain, although the data concerning this outcome are rather scarce and unclear.

The most feasible explanation for this clinically relevant and statistically significant difference (p = 0.04 based on a chi square test), which was not calculated nor discussed in the article [11], is that more patients in the GDT group reached Hb levels below the transfusion threshold due to hemodilution, prompting physicians to order blood transfusions.
